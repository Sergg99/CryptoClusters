# CryptoClusters

## Overview: 

In this assignment we helped Martha creating an analysis for her important client, a prominent investment bank that wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Since there is no known output, Martha is using unsupervised learning to group the cryptocurrencies and has chosen a clustering algorithm for this task. Martha will also process the data to fit the machine learning models and use data visualizations to present her findings to the board.
